  <p>Welcome to my bio page.I am a 34 year old first generation latina working full-time in healthcare during a pandemic and thought it would be a great time to go back to school. I am humbled by my past, grateful for where I am now, and <em>super duper excited</em> for what comes next.</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
      <p>I want to make a <u>difference</u>. I will achieve this by continually attempting to master <em>the art of code</em>. After 16 years in healthcare I am navigating unknown waters. I don't know where a degree in UX Design will take me, but I can't wait to find out! As a newbie <strong>Latinx in Tech</strong>, I am hopefull to inspire others somewhere along the way.</p>
